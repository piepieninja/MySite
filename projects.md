This is not a full list of all projects, just a few that I have taken the time to write down.

## CubeSats ##

Caleb is currently leading the development of 2 Small Satellites, known as CubeSats, at the [University of Georgia's Small Satellite Research Laboritory](http://smallsat.uga.edu). The first of these Satellites, known as SPOC Sat - or Spectral Ocean Color Satellite - will be launched to the space station and deployed in the year 2018.

## Google Glass R&D##

I have worked for a fortune 30 company to research the Retail applications of Google Glass. I have worked as an Undergraduate Researcher at UGA's [Hodgson Glass Research Lab](http://glass.music.uga.edu). I helped make the first musical score viewing application for google glass and assisted Dr. Turner in finding applications for emerging technologies in a classical music setting.
