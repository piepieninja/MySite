      <h2>About</h2>
      <br>
      <p>I'm a computer science student at the <a href="http://uga.edu" target="_blank">University of Georgia</a>. I founded the <a href="http://smallsat.uga.edu" target="_blank">University of Georgia Small Satellite Research Laboratory</a>, which has recived grants from the USAF and NASA to build UGA's first two satellites. The first satellite, SPOC - the SPectral Ocean Color satellite, is slated to launch to the space station some time in 2018.
        The second satellite, MOCI - Multivew Onboard Computational Imager, does some fancy computer graphics things. Check out my <a href="{{base}}/research">research</a> page of details about these satellite systems or their missions.
	I also worked at NASA Johnson on an audio telemetry system for the Orion Spacecraft.
        I spoke at TEDxUGA about the future of space exploration regarding small satellites and citizen science.
        I was one of the founders of UGA's hackathon program, known as <a href="http://www.ugahacks.com/" target="_blank">UGA Hacks</a>.
        I lead the team that won UGA's first hackathon title. This eventually became the company known as Scientific Space Systems LLC, which was bought by Cosmic Delivery.
        I have worked as a beta tester for Google Glass and helped make the first <a href="https://github.com/piepieninja/gdkscoreviewer" target="_blank">musical score viewing app</a> for the device.
        In addition to running the SSRL, I currently work with <a href="http://www.ordercosmic.com">Cosmic Delivery</a> and lead the Compute Vision systems for their autonomous robots.
        In my free time I'll <a href="https://github.com/piepieninja/PiePieNinja.zshrc" target="_blank">mod my terminal</a>, play with my old <a href="https://github.com/piepieninja/IBM-DOS-GAMES" target="_blank">IBM PS/2</a>, play kerbal space program, or eat Taco Bell.
